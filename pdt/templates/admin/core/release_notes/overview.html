    <h3>How to read this document</h3>
    Here are some hints about how to read this document:
    <ul class="nested-list">
        <li>Every release has a note about when itâ€™s expected to go live.</li>
        <li>
            Cases are spread out over categories, these should be fairly self explanatory:
            <ul>
                {% for category in categories %}
                    <li>{{ category.title }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Changes that are made after the release notes were initially written and communicated are marked as such to
            avoid confusion:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If a case is marked underlined it was added to the release
                    (after the release initially went to staging).
                </li>
                <li>If a case is marked strike through it has been removed from the release.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            The release notes are maintained by the Operational IT team, so if you have comments or suggestions feel
            free to <a href="mailto:operational-it@paylogic.com">contact them</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    {% for release, note in notes %}
        <h3><a href="#{{ release.number }}">Release {{ release.number }}</a></h3>
        {{ note | safe }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
